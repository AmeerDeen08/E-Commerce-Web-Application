# 🛒 E-Commerce Web Application

## Overview

This beginner-level full stack project introduces students to the foundations of building a modern **e-commerce platform**. It includes features such as **product listings**, **shopping cart**, **user authentication**, and **order management** — helping students understand how real-world web applications are structured and function.

The objective is to gain practical experience with front-end UI, server-side logic, database management, and API integration — all while simulating a commercial platform.

## 🚀 Goals of the Project

* Understand how an e-commerce application is structured.
* Learn user authentication and session/token handling.
* Implement product listings, cart operations, and checkout flow.
* Develop RESTful APIs for product and order management.
* Connect frontend with backend using asynchronous API calls.
* Practice responsive design and secure data handling.

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

> 📌 *The final tech stack will be discussed as a team.*
> Some recommended options:

* Frontend: React.js / HTML-CSS-JS
* Backend: Node.js with Express / Django / Flask
* Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL
* Authentication: JWT / Session-based
* Deployment: Render / Vercel / Railway / Netlify
* Version Control: Git + GitHub

---

## 🧱 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Architecture

* Setup GitHub repo & folder structure
* Configure frontend and backend boilerplate
* Plan UI wireframes (homepage, product page, cart, login)

### Phase 2: User Authentication

* Implement signup, login, and logout routes
* Use session or token-based authentication
* Secure user data and restrict access to certain routes

### Phase 3: Product Management

* Create product model/schema
* Add feature to list, add, edit, and delete products (admin)
* Create frontend UI for browsing products

### Phase 4: Cart & Checkout

* Build cart system (add/remove/update quantity)
* Store cart in local state or DB (if logged in)
* Simulate order placement and confirmation

### Phase 5: UI Enhancements & Final Touches

* Implement responsive layout for desktop/mobile
* Add product filters or categories
* Show order history per user (optional)
* Polish frontend with animations, loaders, and toast messages

## 📢 Contribution Guidelines

This guide walks you through how to **fork**, **clone**, **write code**, and **create a Pull Request (PR)** to contribute to the official Nexus Club fullstack project repository.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Visit the main project repository link shared by the mentor.
2. Click the **"Fork"** button on the top-right corner.
3. GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your account.

> 🛠 You’ll now have your own copy where you can push your changes safely.

---

## 💻 Step 2: Clone Your Fork Locally

1. Copy the HTTPS clone URL of your fork
   Example:

   ```
   https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-web-application.git
   ```
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-web-application.git
   cd ecommerce-web-application
   ```

---

## 🌿 Step 3: Create a New Branch

Always create a new branch for every new feature or fix.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

> Example: `feature/cart-component` or `bugfix/login-error`

---

## 🧑‍💻 Step 4: Make Changes

Now you're free to code!
Modify files, add new ones, or create your project folder as discussed with the team.

✅ Keep your code clean and readable.
✅ Test everything before committing.

---

## 💾 Step 5: Commit Your Changes

Once you're done:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added: product listing page"
```

---

## 🚀 Step 6: Push Your Branch to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

---

## 📬 Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. You’ll see a banner to create a **Pull Request** — click it.
3. Choose the **base repository** (main club repo) and the branch (`main`) to merge into.
4. Add a **clear title** and **description** of what you’ve done.
5. Click **"Create Pull Request"**.

Wait for the mentor or Fullstack Lead to review your changes and give feedback or approve it for merging.

---

## 🔁 Step 8: Stay Updated with the Main Repo

To avoid conflicts, regularly sync your fork with the main repo.

### Add the main repository as upstream (only once):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nexus-club/ecommerce-web-application.git
```

### Pull the latest changes:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

Now continue from Step 3 again if you want to work on a new feature.

---

## 🙌 Final Notes

* Always pull the latest changes before starting work.
* Keep your branches clean and well-named.
* Follow naming conventions and formatting rules.
* Ask me (FullStack Lead) if you're unsure about anything.
